# Changelog

Newest first. Every release bumps `manifest.json` and `package.json` together.

## 1.21.4 (2026-09-18)

- Build: `tsconfig.json` is `jsx: react-jsx` with `jsxImportSource: @emotion/react`, matching the Experience Builder client. ts-loader reads the widget tsconfig, and the previous classic `jsx: react` setting made the settings panel and runtime fail with "Cannot convert undefined or null to object" after a full rebuild. No functional change.

## 1.21.3 (2026-09-18)

- Added: anonymous usage and error telemetry (shared beacon module; off unless the portal publishes an exb-beacon-sink table; telemetry: false in config disables it).

## 1.21.2 (2026-09-17)

- Packaging: the Visual Studio editor shims are no longer in the release zip. `publish.ps1` strips them from a staging copy (`$ReleaseOnlyExclude`) and refuses to zip if any ambient `declare module` of react, jimu or esri survives. The shims stay in the GitHub repo; clone users delete them before building.
